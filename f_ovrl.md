#### FILE OVERLAP
###### Problem: Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
###### (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that can’t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)

#### DISCUSSION
###### You’ll need to stitch together a few ideas of things I’ve previously talked about on this blog, so if you need a refresher in any of these topics, now is your chance! Of course, there are any number of ways to do this exercise, so these are only suggestions.

#### Topics:
###### 1. Reading a file
###### 2. Number types and converting to integers from strings
###### 3. Lists
